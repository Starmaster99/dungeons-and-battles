# Dungeons and Battles
Quite small, yet fairly complex C++ text-based console RPG, leveraging OOP principles and design patterns made as a homework project for University of Opole.

Made with <3 by Vladislav Kuznietsov, 2024


## Installation & usage
To install and build this project, simply clone the repo and build it using visual studio, which was a requirement[^1] from my professor:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Starmaster99/dungeons-and-battles.git
```

Open the repo's project using visual studio and build it. Then launch the `.exe` file in `dungeons-and-battles\x64\Debug\dungeons-and-battles.exe`. As simple as that.


## Development
If you wish to help me, you can add some things you think will make the game better. Clone the repo and work on.
List of things will objectively make the game better:
- [ ] Translation
- [ ] More enemies
- [ ] More classes
- [ ] Artifacts, consumables - item system
- [ ] Saving and loading game progress system
- [ ] More ideas

## Annotations
[^1]: I don't think we were allowed to use something other than visual studio 2022. I'll rewrite some portions of code and leverage CMake for building the app. I also want to make it crossplatform.
